## Overview

Welcome to the Candy Crush in React project! 🚀 This application brings the classic Candy Crush game to life using the power of React. Swipe candies in any direction (as long as it's not blocked) to create sets of matching candies. With 6 vibrant colors, the challenge is to match 3 or 4 candies of the same color in rows or columns.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:
- **React:** Driving the dynamic and interactive aspects of the Candy Crush game.
- **JavaScript:** Providing the logic and functionality behind the gaming experience.
- **HTML5:** Offering the structure for a seamless gaming experience.
